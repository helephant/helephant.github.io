I have been thinking

Great chess players don't have a single strategy they use , they have a variety of strategies they can apply to different situations. 

I like to imagine I have a toolbox of different tools, techniques, patterns and technologies that I can apply in different situations to solve problems. 

Sometimes being flexible about what I can call upon to solve a problem can be a very powerful thing that allows me to be effective. Sometimes it can be disruptive and . I wanted some ways to identify 

I've been thinking a lot about the difference between things that you want to be flexible about and things that you want to try quite hard to stick to and I have come up with a model of values, strategies and context. 

## Values 
They should capture an outcome, an attribute or a way of working. For example 

Values are not solutions. Things like continous deployment, TDD and squads or tribes are strategies not values, though they reflect the values that the people choosing them hold. 

Values usually change slowly. You don't expect your values to change unless the context changes significantly. Changing values tends to be disruptive. 

Choosing values usually means trading one good thing off for another. Ideally our teams and systems could have anything we wanted, but often choosing more of one thing means having less of something else. This is not a bad thing, as long as we understand the cost of our choices. 

Some examples of values are:
* We choose security over user experience
* We choose team autonomy over consistency across teams
* We choose quality over speed of delivery

When you are making choices, having clear values can help sort the options that may be appropriate from the ones that are not. 

They can help you come up with a coherant set of strategies to achieve something, where the different choices complement each other.

They can help a team of people make decisions that work towards the same goal. They can help a team of people adapt to an unfamilar context. 

People and teams will invariably have values, even if they are not explicit. They will evolve over time as people work together. 

Having discussions about what a team values can help bring people's values closer together so they can work more effectively together. They can be a way for team members to assess options and hold each other accountable as they work together. They can help team members articulate why one option might be better than another one. 

Even if you talk explicitly about values, everyone will have their own idea of exactly what they mean. When a team works together over a longer period of time and makes many decisions together, their understanding of the values will become much more closer. 

It is not realistic to expect a group of people to have perfectly aligned values. However, people with extremely different values may find it difficult to make decisions together. 


## Strategies

Strategies are 

## Context. 

# Some examples
Agile principles are **values**, while the scrum process  is a suggested set of **strategies** that can help your team practice the agile principles.

XP talks about values and strategies. The thing I particularly like about XP is the different strategies complement each other really well. 

TDD is an interesting one because it a strategy that can sometimes be a shorthand way of talking about values like quality, automation, cost of change.
