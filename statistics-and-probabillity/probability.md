Probability is a mathematical framework for reasoning about uncertainity.

A **sample space** is a list of possible outcomes for an event which are: 
* *Mutually exclusive* - each possible outcome in the sample space must only belong to one 
* *collectively exhaustive* - every possible outcome must be included

An **event** is a subset of the sample space. Probability is assigned to events. 

## Probability axioms
1. *nonnegative*: P(A) &geq; 0 - each possible outcome in the sample space must have a probability greater than 0.
2. *normalization* P(&Omega;) &leq; 1 - the total probability of the sample space must be equal to one. It must include all possible outcomes. 
3. *additivity*: if A&Intersection;B = &empty;, then P(A&Union;B) = P(A) + P(B) - if A and B are mutually exclusive, then the probability of both is equal to the probability of A added to the probability of B.

With these axioms it is possible to reason about the probability of different events.
