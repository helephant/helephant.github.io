# 2020 professional development

I have been thinking about a lot about what the next steps are for me professionally, particularly as my youngest child is now at school so I am starting to leave the incredible, but intense small children years behind. 

I want to keep unlocking interesting experiences that expand my experience and perspective, particularly around system design and technical leadership. These have been the two most interesting parts of my jobs in recent years and I think I've only really just started to scratch the surface of them. 

I think the other challenge is keeping my career fresh and interesting after twenty years of working on distributed web systems. In many ways, it is quite wonderful to be able to call on many different experiences. For example, I was able to easily spot an issue with unintentionally shared state between callbacks recently, because it reminded me a lot of a previous issue I'd worked on. At the same time, the same experience can make it easy to be complacent and to get stuck in a rut of picking things that are within my comfort zone. This is not great when keeping up with a constantly changing industry and also is quite boring. I know the difference that feeling challenged and engaged makes to my enthusiasm and performance. It makes work much more fun. 

My free time is limited and I want to invest in myself in a focused way so I can make some meaningful progress. I have seen before the power of doing a little learning often. Here are some things I am either very interested in or I think could be really useful:

* AWS knowledge, particularly around data, data stores and networking
* improving my maths skills. I use probability and statistics all the time at work, so that seems like it would be a good place to start.
* find out more about systems thinking. From my superficial knowledge, it seems like something that would be useful to an architect. 
* learn more about data modelling. I can see from my latest project what a big difference a good data model makes to a system's maintainability
* expand and document my knowledge of architectural patterns that are relevant to the sorts of systems I build.
* build some play books around the sorts of problems I solve often in my work (like caching, API versioning), both as a reference and to deepen my knowledge.

I feel like the biggest challenge I have right now is rekindling my enthusiam to learn things outside of work. I have struggled a lot with energy and motivation in the past few years, particularly at the end of full on days at work and home. I have some weekly time to invest in myself, I just need to get started. I think that means I should choose something that is the furtherest from my current experience. 

# lies, damned lies, and statistics

I think my first development adventure for the year should be doing a course in probability and statistics. There is a MIT EDX course called [6.041 - Probabilistic Systems Analysis and Applied Probability](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-041sc-probabilistic-systems-analysis-and-applied-probability-fall-2013/index.htm) that looks very interesting.

The textbook is [Introduction To Probability](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/188652923X/ref=nosim?slotNum=0&linkCode=g12&imprToken=t-WkAMTm91ePHh1t8nu8Og&tag=miop-21).
